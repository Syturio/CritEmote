## Description
CritEmote is a basic addon that posts a /emote on chat every time you spell crit for more than X amount (7000 by default).

This allows everyone to see for how much you critted, including in Arena.

There are no commands, but you can easily edit the LUA code to change any of the settings.

Addon created for Wrath of the Lich King (3.3.5a), tested on Warmane-Blackrock.
